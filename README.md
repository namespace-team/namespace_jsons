## Mindset
Engineering is not about technology but is about humans. When it's about humans, it's about communications. You should try to improve your communication skills as much as you try to improve your engineering skills.

### Principle
All the people in the countries work together even though the places they live in and the roles they play differ. 
All the communication methods and tips are to maximize the productivity of the whole team.

### Communication costs
Try to reduce communication costs by utilizing async communications and automation.

Reduce task switching by utilizing async communication. You can't ignore him when your colleague speaks to you in person (this is "sync communication"), but in async communication, you can reply to him after you're done with what you're doing.

You don’t have to take someone else from their work if not necessary.

Also, automate as many things as possible. You don't wanna say something in a Slack channel, which you've already said in Github.

### Modes of communications
1. Async communication
Write down everything.

People easily forget important things and you’re not an exception. Chat-based communication is good at keeping history but not remembering it when you haven’t written it, unlike on-site communication where you would ask someone next to you and expect an instant answer from him.

2. Public communications
Be public unless it is confidential.

It is highly encouraged to communicate through Slack and Github issue comments in public while being careful to choose a channel (see "project channel" section for details) or issue to talk about depending on what issue and who you’re trying to address.

Use direct messages only when you talk about something too personal, sensitive, private, undisclosable, or confidential.

3. Face-to-face communications
No need to cut back on face-to-face meetings.

The technology is readily available and it's easier to use than ever whenever you think sync communication is necessary.

We're human, we like to converse. Sometimes it can be critical to talk, even if only for a minute when all other communication is written.
